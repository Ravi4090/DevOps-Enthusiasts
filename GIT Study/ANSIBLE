ANSIBLE
ITS A DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION TOOL, USES PUSH APPROACH TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES,BY MANAGING ALL THE SERVERS THROUGH ONE SINGLE MACHINE RUNNING.A PRODUCT OF REDHAT, ALWAYS INSTALLED ON A LINUX SERVER.

>ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE - A MACHINE IN WHICH ANSIBLE IS INSTALLED.
4 MAIN COMPONENTS - INVENTORY,PLAYBOOK,MODULES,ansible.cfg

>MANAGED HOSTS/WORKER NODES/ANSIBLE HOST - VM's CONNECTED TO ANSIBLE CONTROLLER, NO ANSIBLE IS INSTALLED ON THIS VM's.FOR THIS REASON ANSIBLE IS CALLED AS AGENTLESS TOOLS. PYTHON is pre-requisite IN THESE VM's WHICH WILL BE BY DEFAULT IN LINUX MACHINES.

SSH IS PROTOCOL THROUGH WHICH 2 LINUX MACHINES CONNECT WITH EACHOTHER , FOR WINDOWS IS WINRM.

>>>INVENTORY - IS A SIMPLE TEXT FILE INWHICH WE WRITE DOWN THE IP ADDRESS/HOSTNAME OF REMOTE SERVERS WHERE WE HAVE TO DO CONFIGURATION.
***HOST IS INVENTORY FILE, WHICH WILL COME BY DEFAULT, WE ADD ANSIBLE HOST VM's HERE USING PRIVATEIP(RECOMMENNDED)***
***ANSIBLE COMMAND SHOULD BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS ANSIBLE.CFG AND HOST FILE***

>>>MODULES(4000+ modules are there in ansible) ARE SMALL PYTHON CODE THAT IS ALREADY WRITTEN IN ANSIBLE, AS ADMIN WE WILL USE THIS MODULE TO APPLY CHANGES ON REMOTE MODULES.

LIKE copy(/source/file1/,/destination/file)

>>>PLAYBOOK ANSIBLE CODE WILL BE WRITTEN IN PLAYBOOK.2 main things are hosts server, modules to be executed.WRITTEN IN YAML, WILL HAVE A SET OF PLAYS.

PROCESS FLOW >>> ansible code(yaml) > python code(converted in controller machine) > will connect to and run it in host nodes > after changes >reports back to ansible controller > deletes python code in host nodes

ansibl.cfg >>> IS A FILE , COMES PRE-INSTALLED WITH ANSIBLE.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT(MAKING CHANGES ON DIFF. SERVERS USING A TOOL)

IS ABOUT BRINGING CONSISTENCY IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE,ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM ,STATE,AND ENV IS KNOWN ,TRUSTED, AND AGREED UPON BY ALL.
IT HELPS IN RECORDING ALL THE CHANGES MADE TO TEH SERVERS/IN THE SYSTEM.
PROVIDE AN EASIER APPROACH TO MANAGE AND CONFIGURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
ANSIBLE IS A CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL.


================================================steps on ANSIBLE CONTROLLER AND ON ALL ANSIBLE HOSTS========================================================

vim sudo /etc/ansible/hosts > ADD IPADDRESS OF HOST VM's

CREATE USER AND PASSWORD FROM ROOT USER
adduser ansiuser
passwd ansiuser

vim sudo /etc/ssh/sshd_config
scroll down till password autheticationa and set it to yes


IN sudo /vim/sudoers   #simple linux file , it is a system file
SCROLL DOWN TILL root 
add 
ANSIUSER ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL

systemctl restart sshd

Host file - will hv ip of vm's to be connected to ansible control node . Host file consists of all ip addresses of host machines where we have to do changes on target servers.

Configuration File: The Ansible configuration file, often named ansible.cfg, is a settings file that allows you to customize how Ansible behaves. It contains various options that control things like the default inventory file location, connection settings, logging preferences, and more. You can use the configuration file to tailor Ansible to suit your specific needs and preferences. By default, Ansible looks for the configuration file in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg on the control node, but you can specify a different location if needed.




su - ansiuser
ssh-keygen    (look in directory for public and private keys)


>>>>>>>>SWITCH TO HOST NODE

change hostname using-
sudo hostname ansiblenode

>>>>>>>>NOW FROM ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE
ssh-copy-id -i ansiuser@<privateipofHOSTNODE>

**WE CAN CONNECT TO HOST NODE FROM CONTROLLER NODE USING COMMAND SHOWN IN RESULTS AFTER RUNNING ABOVE COMMAND/ AFTER CONNECTING TO HOST NODE**

cd /etc/ansible
vim hosts
add - 
<hostgroup>
hostnode privateip


Running command on hostgroups from control node--

ansible webserver -m ping
or
ansible all -m ping
ansible webserver -m command -a "uptime"
ansible webserver -m command -a "df-h"
ansible webserver -m command -a "touch /tmp/file1"

it will check prev. tasks and intsall/start new task**
