# Module 3 : Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps in tracking changes in source code during software development. In simple terms, it allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, keeping track of every modification made to the codebase. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become the most widely used version control system.

In a nutshell, Git helps manage and coordinate work among multiple people, preventing conflicts and making it easier to roll back to previous versions of the code if needed.

## Why use Git?

Using Git offers several benefits for software development:

1. **Version Control:** Git allows developers to keep track of changes to their code over time. This means you can see the entire history of modifications, who made them, and when.

2. **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git enables efficient collaboration by managing changes and resolving conflicts.

3. **Branching and Merging:** Git makes it easy to create branches for different features or bug fixes. Developers can work on their tasks independently in separate branches and then merge their changes back into the main codebase when ready.

4. **Undo Changes:** If a mistake is made or if a feature needs to be rolled back, Git allows developers to revert to previous versions easily.

5. **Remote Repositories:** Git facilitates the sharing of code across different locations. Developers can work on the same project, even if they are geographically dispersed.

6. **Open Source:** Git is open-source software, meaning that it's free to use and has a large community of contributors. This ensures continuous improvement and updates.

## Key Features of Git with Simple Software Development Examples:

1. **Committing Changes:**
   - **Description:** Saving changes to the local repository.
   - **Example:** After writing and testing a new function, you commit the changes with a message like "Added a new search algorithm."

2. **Branching:**
   - **Description:** Creating a separate line of development to work on a new feature or bug fix.
   - **Example:** Creating a branch named "feature-login-page" to implement a new login page without affecting the main codebase.

3. **Merging:**
   - **Description:** Combining changes from one branch into another.
   - **Example:** Merging the changes made in the "feature-login-page" branch into the main branch to incorporate the new login page.

4. **Pull Requests:**
   - **Description:** Proposing changes and requesting their integration into the main codebase.
   - **Example:** After completing a feature, you create a pull request to merge your changes into the master branch for review.

5. **Clone and Fork:**
   - **Description:** Copying a repository to work on it locally (clone) or on a remote server (fork).
   - **Example:** Cloning a repository to your local machine to start contributing to an open-source project.

6. **Undoing Changes:**
   - **Description:** Reverting to a previous state of the code.
   - **Example:** Using the "git revert" command to undo the last commit that introduced a bug.
